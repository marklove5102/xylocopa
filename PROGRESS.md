### 2026-03-22 | Task: Incremental JSONL sync | Status: success
- What: Replaced full-file `_parse_session_turns(path)` in sync_import_new_turns with turn-boundary-aware incremental reading
- Attempts: Previous attempts failed — (1) acbe56a tried merge-based incremental parsing, collapsed distinct assistant turns → infinite compact loops. (2) b84a55d tried hook-first message creation, `created_at DESC` ordering targeted wrong message → content loss.
- Resolution: Three-layer approach — `_read_new_lines()` reads only new bytes via seek, `sync_parse_incremental()` re-parses only from last turn boundary (not the merge approach), `_parse_session_turns_from_lines()` refactored to accept lines directly. Compact/reset does full re-read to repopulate cache.
- Lesson: Don't try to merge partial assistant turn state incrementally — instead track the last user/system entry as a "stable boundary" and re-parse from there with the proven flush_assistant() logic. The I/O savings (seek-based read) are safe; the CPU savings (only parse tail) are safe because we re-parse from a known turn boundary, not from an arbitrary byte offset.
- Gotcha 1: `_read_new_lines` must use binary mode (`rb`) for byte-offset tracking. Text mode + manual byte counting drifts with multi-byte UTF-8 chars.
- Gotcha 2: The boundary scanner must match the parser's turn-boundary semantics EXACTLY. tool_result user entries (list content) are NOT turn boundaries — the parser skips them. If the scanner treats them as boundaries, it splits assistant turns → compact purge deletes the finer-grained messages → bubbles "disappear."
- Gotcha 3: Don't preset `stable_turn_count` at init while `stable_boundary` is 0 — the splice duplicates all turns.

### 2026-03-22 | Task: Modularize main.py into APIRouter modules | Status: success
- What: Split the 8197-line monolithic main.py into 11 router modules under orchestrator/routers/, plus route_helpers.py for shared code. main.py → 374 lines (app setup, middleware, lifespan, router includes).
- Attempts: Spawned 5 parallel agents for large routers (system, projects, tasks, hooks, agents), wrote 6 small routers directly. Needed post-fix pass for cross-router imports.
- Resolution: All 116 API routes preserved. Verified via import checks, route enumeration, and server smoke test.
- Lesson: When agents create router modules, they tend to import from the original `main` module for cross-cutting helpers — must fix these to proper cross-router imports (deferred) before the final main.py rewrite. Duplicate helper functions across routers are inevitable; move them to a shared helpers module (route_helpers.py) and alias them in each router to preserve original call-site names.

### 2026-03-23 | Task: Fix duplicate message bubbles (chat ebd418428b1e) | Status: success
- What: `_is_turn_boundary()` in sync_engine.py didn't match `_parse_session_turns_from_lines()` in agent_dispatcher.py. `queue-operation remove/dequeue` and filtered system subtypes (`turn_duration`, `stop_hook_summary`) were treated as boundaries by the incremental parser but ignored by the full parser, creating phantom duplicate assistant turns. Added UNIQUE partial index on `(agent_id, jsonl_uuid)` as defense-in-depth, with best-row dedup cleanup and per-row savepoint handling.
- Gotcha 1: When two functions answer "is this a turn boundary?" they MUST stay in exact sync. Any entry that one treats as a boundary but the other skips will cause phantom turns during incremental parsing.
- Gotcha 2: "Keep oldest duplicate" is wrong — the phantom (truncated) row is often older. Keep the best row (non-null metadata, longer content, later timestamps).
- Gotcha 3: Hooks overload `jsonl_uuid` with `hook-{tool_use_id}` — unique index must exclude `hook-%` to avoid constraining hook-created rows.
- Gotcha 4: Batch `db.commit()` with a unique index needs per-row `db.begin_nested()` (SAVEPOINT) — one duplicate conflict would otherwise roll back all valid turns.

### 2026-03-23 | Task: Fix remaining message sync issues (#2, #4, #5, #8) | Status: success
- What: Fixed 4 additional issues found during the duplicate-bubble investigation: (1) tool-only messages hiding InteractiveBubbles, (2) hook+JSONL creating duplicate interactive cards, (3) windowed answer repair with unescaped LIKE, (4) system messages never purged after compact.
- Resolution: Three parallel agent teams — Team A: canonicalize hook rows at JSONL import time (upgrade `hook-{tool_use_id}` rows in-place instead of inserting duplicates), Team B: fallback ChatBubble in frontend for tool-only messages with interactive metadata, Team C: replace limit(10/20) scans with targeted tool_use_id LIKE prefilter + Counter-based system message purge.
- Lesson 1: Hook-created rows (`hook-{tool_use_id}`) and JSONL-synced rows represent the same assistant turn — canonicalize at import time by upgrading the hook row, not at render time or in a post-hoc reconciliation pass.
- Lesson 2: `LIKE '%{user_input}%'` needs `%` and `_` escaped. Prefer it as a prefilter with JSON verification after, not as the sole match.
- Lesson 3: System messages lack UUIDs — content-based purge needs Counter (multiset) not set, because identical system messages can legitimately appear multiple times.
- Deferred: #1 lossy user-turn dedup (needs parser provenance), #3 ToolActivity identity (schema redesign), #6 non-transactional offset (reconcile covers), #7 same-size rewrite (unlikely).

### 2026-03-23 | Investigation: session ebd418428b1e "lost messages" in web app | Status: investigation-only
- What: Agent ebd418428b1e (gsv-tc-fusion, 570+ messages, 9 compacts, 30 subagents) appeared to have missing/reordered messages in the web chat. Root cause is NOT data loss — only 2 trivial JSONL turns (1 compact marker, 1 task-notification) are missing from the DB.
- Root cause 1 (sort order disruption): `sync_reconcile_initial` content-dedup path sets `delivered_at = _utcnow()` on matched messages (sync_engine.py:424). Since the API sorts by `COALESCE(delivered_at, far_future)`, this jumps messages to a much later sort position. The "Confirmed" message was created at 08:01 UTC but sorted at 08:44 UTC — a 42-minute displacement.
- Root cause 2 (spurious compact detection): ANY turn count decrease (even ±1 from parser dedup fluctuation) triggers the compact path — purge + reconcile. 7 false-compact events logged for this agent, purging 13 messages and reconciling 9. Each reconcile resets `delivered_at` on content-matched messages. **Critical: Claude Code JSONL is append-only — compact appends a `compact_boundary` system entry but never deletes/modifies existing entries.** The turn count decreases are entirely from the parser's content-based dedup producing different results on consecutive full parses, NOT from JSONL changes. The sync engine is purging messages based on a phantom signal.
- Root cause 3 (duplicate web messages): User resent identical messages (3× "Yeah, we still want…", 2× "So we need two more gen3c…"). No client-side dedup. Session continuation also re-imports user content as cli-source duplicates.
- Lesson 1: `delivered_at` serves double duty as transport ACK and sort key — reconcile resetting it breaks chronological order. Fix: use `created_at` or a separate `sort_at` column for ordering; reserve `delivered_at` for delivery tracking only.
- Lesson 2: Turn count decrease ≠ compact. Claude Code JSONL is **append-only** — the file never shrinks. Detect compacts by checking for new `compact_boundary` system entries (subtype="compact_boundary"), not by turn count delta. The parser's content-based dedup makes turn counts non-deterministic.
- Lesson 3: Client-side dedup needed for web message sends — prevent duplicate submissions within a short window.
- Lesson 4: Queue-operations in JSONL have NO UUIDs (verified: 324 entries, 0 with UUID). Parser comment at agent_dispatcher.py:1417 is correct. Turns created from queue-ops are inherently uuid-less, making them invisible to UUID-based dedup/purge — only content-based matching applies.

### 2026-03-23 | Fix: plan card option index mismatch after Claude Code v2.1.81 | Status: done
- What: Selecting "Yes, clear context & bypass" on the plan card did not clear context. Investigation revealed Claude Code v2.1.81 hides the "clear context" option by default (restorable via `showClearContextOnPlanAccept: true`). Our frontend and backend still had 4 options with "clear context" at index 0, causing all tmux key mappings to be off by one vs the actual 3-option TUI.
- Fix: Removed phantom "clear context & bypass" option from PLAN_OPTIONS (frontend), _PLAN_LABELS (backend), _PLAN_LABELS_LOWER (sync), and updated all index references (legacy fallback, planning agent handoff, keyword detection).
- Lesson: When Claude Code upgrades change TUI options, our hardcoded index mappings silently break. The tmux pane capture logs showed the real 3-option TUI but nobody noticed the mismatch. Future: parse pane content to detect available options dynamically instead of hardcoding indices.

### 2026-03-23 | Task: Sync architecture redesign (tool_use_id, session_seq, scan-as-audit) | Status: success
- What: Replaced the fragile multi-layer sync architecture (5 dedup layers, 4+2 sync flows, 45+ special-case branches) with explicit identity, explicit ordering, and audit-based drift detection.
- Resolution: 4 rounds, 7 agent teams, 9 commits:
  - Round 1: Added `tool_use_id` and `session_seq` columns to Message/ToolActivity + SyncDrift model + migration/backfill + integration test harness with 8 scenarios
  - Round 2: Replaced all LIKE queries on meta_json with tool_use_id column lookups; set session_seq on all message creation paths
  - Round 3: Switched API/frontend ordering from delivered_at heuristics to session_seq
  - Round 4: Converted scan from silent repair to audit — sync_reconcile_initial went from 280 lines to 20; removed content-sig fallback from import path; added sync_audit/sync_repair functions + admin endpoints
- Lesson 1: Add explicit identity columns (tool_use_id) early — eliminates LIKE scans, JSON parsing, and prefix-matching heuristics in one move.
- Lesson 2: Separate ordering from delivery tracking — session_seq (monotonic JSONL turn index) is deterministic; delivered_at serves double duty and gets corrupted by reconciliation.
- Lesson 3: Audit vs repair must be separate code paths. Silent repair (content-sig matching, stale metadata sweep) hides bugs and adds complexity. Explicit drift records make problems visible.
- Lesson 4: sync_reconcile_initial was the biggest complexity source — 280 lines of interleaved check+fix. Replacing it with import+audit cut complexity dramatically.

### 2026-03-23 | Task: Voice LLM post-processing (口误修正) | Status: success
- What: Added GPT-4o-mini post-processing to refine voice transcription — corrects speech errors, grammar, and punctuation before text is injected into input field. Inspired by Type4Me's approach.
- Attempts: Straightforward — no issues. Integrated refinement inside useVoiceRecorder hook so all 7+ call sites get it automatically without individual changes.
- Lesson: Hook-level integration > call-site-level for cross-cutting concerns — adding the refine step inside the hook avoided touching every caller.

### 2026-03-24 | Task: Keep display files for stopped agents | Status: success
- What: Stopped/errored agents showed empty chat because `stop_agent_cleanup` and `error_agent_cleanup` deleted the display JSONL file. Removed those deletions so chat history persists. Moved display file cleanup to `permanently_delete_agent` (which was also missing it).
- Resolution: Straightforward — removed 2 `delete_agent()` calls, added cleanup to permanent delete endpoint.
- Lesson: Display files are the frontend's sole source of truth for chat history — deleting them on stop is premature. Only delete on permanent removal.

### 2026-03-24 | Task: Stack insight/attachment bubbles below chat bubbles | Status: success
- What: User message wrapper had `flex items-center gap-2` causing attachments and insights to render horizontally beside the bubble. Changed to `flex flex-col items-end` with an inner `flex items-center gap-2` row for just the warning icon + bubble.
- Resolution: Straightforward — two edits in ChatBubble's return JSX in AgentChatPage.jsx.
- Lesson: When a flex container holds both primary content (bubble) and secondary content (attachments, insights), use flex-col for the outer wrapper and an inner flex-row only for elements that truly belong side-by-side.

### 2026-03-24 | Task: Fix duplicate initial prompt bubble in task agents | Status: success
- What: Task agents showed two user bubbles — the clean description (from `_create_task_agent`) and the full wrapped prompt (from JSONL sync). Root cause: `is_wrapped_prompt()` only detected `_build_agent_prompt` preamble (`"You are working in project:"`), but the JSONL parser already strips that. The remaining `_build_task_prompt` output (`# Task: ...`) was not recognized as wrapped, so `_promote_or_create_user_msg` fell to the raw-prompt path (exact content match, no FIFO fallback) and created a duplicate CLI message.
- Resolution: Extracted matching logic from `_promote_or_create_user_msg` into `ContentMatcher` class (`content_matcher.py`) with 6-strategy cascade: exact → task-stripped → normalized → task-normalized → contained → FIFO. Handles task prompt wrapping (`# Task:`, insights, guidelines), tmux tab→space normalization, and retry format (`## Original Task`). Also added `# Task:` detection to `is_wrapped_prompt()` for reconciliation filtering.
- Lesson: When content passes through multiple strip layers (parser strips `_build_agent_prompt`, then sync checks `is_wrapped_prompt`), the detection must recognize all intermediate states. A dedicated matcher class is cleaner than inline branching — it encapsulates all transformation awareness in one place.

### 2026-03-24 | Task: Align non-tmux agent pipeline with tmux agents | Status: success
- What: Non-tmux (`claude -p`) agents had a broken display pipeline — agent response messages created at harvest never reached the display file (`data/display/{agent_id}.jsonl`), so the chat UI was empty after page refresh. Added a parallel exec sync pipeline that runs during subprocess execution, reusing the same `sync_engine` and `display_writer` infrastructure as tmux agents.
- Resolution: Created `start_exec_sync()` + `_exec_sync_loop()` as separate methods from tmux's `start_session_sync()` + `_sync_session_loop_inner()` — zero changes to tmux code paths. Exec sync starts at dispatch (for --resume) or from SessionStart hook (first exec). Harvest skips message creation when sync already imported turns, falls back to existing harvest if sync didn't run. Added unconditional `flush_agent()` at end of harvest as safety net.
- Lesson 1: `claude -p` writes session JSONL to `~/.claude/projects/` just like interactive sessions, and hooks fire with AHIVE_AGENT_ID — so the full JSONL sync pipeline works for subprocess agents too.
- Lesson 2: Keep new pipelines parallel (separate methods, separate task dicts) rather than modifying existing stable ones — merge later when confident.

### 2026-03-24 | Task: Allow sending messages to busy tmux agents | Status: success
- What: Removed the ban on sending messages to executing tmux agents. Messages are now injected via tmux send-keys immediately and tracked as QUEUED until JSONL confirms delivery.
- Attempts: Straightforward — no issues. Tested tmux buffer behavior: multiple messages sent while Claude is generating are processed sequentially (C-u + text + Enter per message).
- Resolution: Added MessageStatus.QUEUED, renamed _dispatch_tmux_pending → _dispatch_tmux_scheduled (scheduled-only), moved delivered_at from UserPromptSubmit hook to sync engine (uses JSONL timestamp), removed ContentMatcher strategies 5+6 (contained/fifo), removed queue param from API.
- Lesson 1: tmux send-keys works fine even during active generation — keystrokes buffer in the terminal and Claude processes them one at a time after each turn completes.
- Lesson 2: Consolidating delivered_at into the sync engine (from JSONL timestamp) is more accurate than server utcnow() from the hook — single source of truth.

### 2026-03-24 | Task: Fix post-compact stuck typing indicator + delayed session rotation | Status: success
- What: After `/compact`, agent was stuck forever — typing indicator spinning, status locked at "executing". Two bugs: (1) PostCompact never called `_stop_generating()`, so `_generating_agents` in-memory set and `agent_stream_end` WS event were never cleared. (2) Session rotation relied on 60s idle poll detection; non-tmux agents had no rotation at all.
- Resolution: PostCompact now calls `ad._stop_generating()` (emits `agent_stream_end`), differentiates tmux (SYNCING) vs non-tmux (IDLE) status, and cancels exec sync for non-tmux. SessionStart(compact) now directly calls `_rotate_agent_session()` for tmux agents (instant rotation + wake sync) and updates session_id + writes continuation bubble for non-tmux agents.
- Lesson: When a hook needs to clear "generating" state, it must call `_stop_generating()` not just set `generating_msg_id = None` in DB — the in-memory set and WS event are the signals the frontend uses for the typing indicator.

### 2026-03-24 — Disable text input when agent status is STARTING
- What: Added `isStarting` check to disable the chat input bar when an agent's status is "STARTING", with placeholder text "Agent is starting…"
- Attempts: Straightforward — no issues. Three-line change in AgentChatPage.jsx.
- Lesson: The disabled logic chain (`isStarting || isStopped || isError || hasPendingInteractive`) should be checked whenever new blocking statuses are introduced.

### 2026-03-24 | Task: Switch voice from streaming to batch record-then-transcribe | Status: success
- What: Replaced OpenAI Realtime API streaming transcription with simpler batch approach: record fully via MediaRecorder → upload to Whisper API → optional LLM refine. Inspired by Stet's architecture.
- Resolution: Rewrote useVoiceRecorder.js (MediaRecorder instead of AudioWorklet + WebSocket), deleted voice_stream.py (Realtime API proxy) and pcm-processor.js (AudioWorklet), removed /ws/transcribe route, replaced streamingText displays with refining indicator across 7 files.
- Lesson: The batch `POST /api/voice` endpoint and `transcribeVoice()` API call already existed (legacy code) — the migration was mostly a frontend hook rewrite. MediaRecorder is dramatically simpler than AudioWorklet + WebSocket + bidirectional proxy.

### 2026-03-24 | Task: Fix input bar jitter while typing with keyboard open | Status: partial
- What: Eliminated body scroll fight that caused visible input bar shake during typing.
- Attempts: (1) 8px dead zone on container height updates — reduced height-change jitter but didn't fix body scroll oscillation. (2) `interactive-widget=resizes-content` + body overflow lock + once-on-open scrollTo — body overflow lock had to be reverted (broke iOS scroll).
- Lesson: `interactive-widget=resizes-content` was the WRONG direction — on iOS 17.4+ Safari supports it, so it causes the layout viewport to resize on every keyboard animation frame, thrashing the entire DOM (h-screen, fixed modals, everything).

### 2026-03-24 | Task: Fix retry task prompt dedup in content matcher | Status: success
- What: Retry task prompts (attempt #2+) created duplicate chat bubbles — the full wrapped `# Task: ...` prompt appeared alongside the clean display message. ContentMatcher failed to match retry JSONL content against the DB message because (1) `_TASK_BODY_RE` incorrectly matched retry prompts (captured all retry sections as "description" since `## Before You Start` exists in both formats), and (2) no strategy handled the case where stripped description is a subset of the display_content.
- Resolution: Two fixes in content_matcher.py: (a) Check for `## Your Focus` before trying `_TASK_BODY_RE` — retry prompts now correctly fall through to `_RETRY_BODY_RE` which extracts just the original description. (b) Added strategy 5 `task-description-contained` — after strategies 1-4 fail, checks if the stripped description (>20 chars) is a substring of any candidate's normalized content. This handles retry display_content = title + desc + retry info.
- Lesson: When two regex patterns can both match the same input (non-retry `_TASK_BODY_RE` matched retry prompts because both end with `## Before You Start`), the more specific pattern must be checked first. Substring containment is a safe fallback strategy when the candidate pool is small (unlinked messages per agent).

### 2026-03-24 | Task: Fix full-app keyboard jitter (attempt #2) | Status: success
- What: Whole app (including fixed-position modals) jittered when keyboard appeared.
- Root cause: Two compounding issues: (1) `interactive-widget=resizes-content` in viewport meta caused the layout viewport to resize on every keyboard animation frame, triggering relayout of every element using h-screen/vh/%. (2) The keyboard tracking code in AgentChatPage changed `kbContainerRef.style.height` on every 100ms tick, causing layout thrashing within the chat page.
- Resolution: (a) Removed `interactive-widget=resizes-content` from viewport meta — layout viewport now stays stable, only visualViewport changes. (b) Replaced container height manipulation with CSS custom property (`--kb-h`) — container stays `h-full` always, input bar uses `bottom: var(--kb-h)`, scroll container gets dynamic `paddingBottom` via direct DOM. No layout thrashing at any level.
- Lesson: Never use `interactive-widget=resizes-content` for keyboard handling — it causes viewport-level layout thrashing. Use `visualViewport` API + CSS custom properties to offset specific elements instead. Container height changes cause layout thrashing; CSS variable + bottom offset only repositions the target elements.

### 2026-03-24 | Task: Fix keyboard adaptiveness (attempt #3) | Status: success
- What: Input bar was rigid / non-adaptive to keyboard layout changes (English ↔ Chinese) after attempt #2's CSS variable + 8px dead zone approach.
- Root cause: The CSS variable approach (`--kb-h`) with 8px dead zone suppressed small keyboard height changes. The `kbHeight` prop was passed as `kbOpen ? 1 : 0` (boolean only), losing actual pixel height information. The golden version (commit `b2f17ae`) was the correct approach all along.
- Resolution: Reverted to the golden version approach — React state `kbOffset` updated on every poll tick (no dead zone), input bar `bottom: ${kbOffset}px` via inline style, scroll padding `${kbOffset + 144}px` via React. Removed CSS variable indirection and `kbContainerRef`.
- Lesson: The golden version (`b2f17ae`) formula `window.innerHeight - vv.height - vv.offsetTop` with direct React state was the simplest and most adaptive approach. The CSS variable "optimization" and dead zone added complexity while removing the very adaptiveness the user valued. Don't over-optimize working code — React re-renders for a single state value are cheap.

### 2026-03-24 | Task: Discourage agents from updating PROGRESS.md | Status: success
- What: Changed task prompt in `agent_dispatcher.py` so agents are told NOT to write to PROGRESS.md. User is setting up a controlled process for selected sessions only.
- Resolution: Replaced the "append to PROGRESS.md" guideline with "Do NOT write to or modify PROGRESS.md". Removed retry prompt's instruction to log failures there. Reading PROGRESS.md for context is still allowed.
- Lesson: Straightforward — no issues. Two locations in `_build_task_prompt()`: the main guidelines block (line ~2756) and the retry instructions block (line ~2726).
