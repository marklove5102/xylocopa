## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Split-screen pane chat header: replace the X (close) icon with the chevron-left back arrow and switch to `resolveBack()` logic so the pane respects the navigation state chain (e.g. A→B→back goes to A) instead of always returning to `/agents`.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- BookmarksSection rows: shrink primary line to 13px; swap title/description in row layout; drop the "note" pill.
- Right-side bookmark icon on a row toggles in both directions; second click on the filled icon removes the bookmark.
- Empty-state hint reworded long-press → double-tap to match the new gesture.

### Fixed

- Keep de-bookmarked rows visible until the next page mount so the row doesn't vanish mid-toggle.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- **Bookmarked messages.** Double-tap a chat bubble → **Bookmark** to save standout turns. New `bookmarked_messages` table + `routers/bookmarks.py` CRUD endpoints. Each bookmark stores the message id, an optional user note, and a `gpt-4o-mini`-generated summary + emoji. Media references (image/file paths) are extracted from the bookmarked message and ±2 neighbors and cached. Per-project **Bookmarks** section; tapping a row scrolls to the original turn with a yellow focus-flash (2 cycles, tinted by the bubble's own color).
- Post-bookmark note prompt — compact amber pill that expands into a textarea inline; the AI summary serves as the title fallback if you skip.
- Bookmark icon on attachment action buttons (the chat-bubble menu remains the canonical entry for text bookmarks).
- Service Worker now caches Fluent UI emoji SVGs `CacheFirst`.

### Changed

- Chat-bubble interaction: **double-tap** opens the per-message action menu (Copy / Modify / Delete / Bookmark). Long-press menu trigger removed; only one menu is open at a time; outside-pointerdown auto-closes.
- MonitorContext warms its cache 2s after app mount, then background-polls every 60s while inactive.

## [0.8.9] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- ESC-then-queued-dispatch race that put the just-sent user bubble *above* the assistant turns and the "Request interrupted by user" bubble in chat. `dispatch_pending_message` now drains pending JSONL turns synchronously before allocating `display_seq`, so the interrupt and any in-flight agent activity get their seq first and the promoted user message lands after them in chronological order.

## [0.8.8] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Offline-resilient adoption path for unmanaged CLI sessions: `session-start.sh` writes `/tmp/xy-pending-unlinked/pane-{key}.json` when its HTTP call fails, mirroring the existing managed-agent `xy-{id}.newsession` fallback.
- `POST /api/unlinked-sessions/replay` with a liveness check (live `claude` pane whose currently-open JSONL matches the stashed `session_id`) plus the same 4-layer guards as the live hook path. Lifespan auto-replays stashes on backend startup; the Agents page refresh button also triggers replay.

### Changed

- Removed `redispatch_stuck_queued`; folded its logic into `dispatch_pending_message`. The previous EXECUTING guard checked `agent.generating_msg_id`, which has been dead-set to `None` since the 4/27 sync_engine refactor — meaning queued messages could promote pre-sent → sent while Claude was mid-turn. The 10s age cutoff is also removed under the pre_sent architecture.

### Fixed

- `sync_full_scan` content_mismatch audit now skips USER turns; a `stop_hook_summary` landing on a USER turn previously triggered spurious drift logs.

### Removed

- "CLI sessions started while backend is offline" entry from README's Known Issues and TODO.md (now handled by the stash + replay path above).

## [0.8.7] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- `sync_full_scan` benign-drift branch advancing pointer past missing UUIDs. When `earliest_missing_idx >= ctx.last_turn_count`, the previous code unconditionally set `ctx.last_turn_count = len(turns)`, jumping the pointer over the missing UUID and making the next `sync_import_new_turns` slice miss it forever. Result: `tool_use` turns silently absent from DB until a later `real-drift` rewind happened to catch them. Fix: leave the pointer at `_earliest_missing_idx`.

### Added

- `DRIFT_INSTRUMENT` logging (`sync_start`, `sync_done`, `drift_detected`, `count_mismatch`, `savepoint_integrity_error`, `compact_purge`). Log-only, no behavior change.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Split `/display` into `/display/sent` and `/display/pre-sent` endpoints; chat state split into `sentMessages` + `preSentMessages` so delivered and queued bubbles render independently.
- `display_writer` writes `seq=0` retry marker on agent create; `dispatcher` emits `pre_sent_tombstoned` event on promote so the frontend can drop the queued bubble.
- Persist deferred-section expanded state across reloads (inbox & agents).
- Base screenshots for input bar, inbox defer, and new agent for the getting-started walkthrough.

### Changed

- Sync state machine: accumulate `_saw_*` signals across `new_turns` instead of reading only the last turn — out-of-order JSONL writes (trailing assistant after `stop_hook_summary`) no longer mask the stop signal.
- New rule: `saw_assistant_turn → EXECUTING`. Sync now flips `IDLE → EXECUTING` from JSONL truth alone, without depending on the `user_prompt` hook chain.
- ESC / interrupt: write `IDLE` directly when interrupting `EXECUTING`; send `C-l` instead of `End + C-u` for reliable input clear in the tmux pane.
- `/display/sent`: sort messages by `seq` for deterministic ordering.
- AgentChatPage compact header drops the redundant status dot, softens Stop/Resume to ghost pills, drops branch text from row 2 (icon-only worktree pill is enough).
- README notes third-party / local model support and the UI scope caveat; drops the iPad / mobile-browser known issue.

### Fixed

- Stale localStorage when an expanded inbox card is collapsed via outside-click.
- Tap-to-edit title/description on expanded inbox cards; place caret at click point on first edit tap.
- NewTaskPage: align worktree input row to the Effort selector's right edge.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- Persist JSONL sync pointer to DB to eliminate full history replay on restart.
- Skip stop-hook / interrupt / rate-limit side effects on initial scan.
- Skip status inference on initial / pointer-reset scan.
- Distinguish real drift from benign timing gaps in `sync_full_scan`; add EXECUTING inference + plumb compact trigger; emit missing /compact completion signals; derive last-turn signal correctly + wake_sync on tool_activity.
- Drain old JSONL + reset sync pointer on session rotation; trust DB on `_recover_agents` + stale fallback; slim `_start/_stop_generating` to in-memory only; emit `agent_update` after `rebuild_agent` on session rotation.
- Hooks only `wake_sync`, never write status directly. Router drops launch-task IDLE write + resume fallback.
- Rename `MessageStatus.QUEUED` → `SENT`; restore inbox-card tag click → popover.

### Fixed

- `UnboundLocalError` on `_time` in sync loop.

### Removed

- Dead `MessageStatus.PENDING` and `TIMEOUT` enum values.
- Client-side telemetry 20h gate; rely on Worker per-day dedup.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- Telemetry: drop the client-side 20h gate, `last_heartbeat` file, and `force` parameter. `record_heartbeat()` now resolves `install_id` and POSTs unconditionally; the Worker handles per-day dedup for Discord while D1 keeps the full event stream. Schedule a 24h heartbeat loop in the FastAPI lifespan so long-running orchestrators that never restart still ping daily.
- Chat-message WS events are now signal-only (no payload).
- Renamed predelivery → pre_sent across the codebase + idempotent migration for legacy rows.
- Dispatcher emits `agent_update` after `rebuild_agent` on session rotation; emits `predelivery_tombstoned` on bulk-fail.
- `sync_engine` emits the missing `/compact` completion signal and emits `new_message` for any insert (covers post-compact and CLI-typed user messages).
- Subagents are filtered from the project agent list, with a legacy backfill.
- Restored tag-click → popover on inbox cards; deferred-section header layout uses a 3-col grid.

### Fixed

- Telemetry restart-within-20h-of-previous-send no longer silently swallows the heartbeat.

### Removed

- Dead `agent_stream` token-streaming code path.
- Eight earlier `agent_update` / `task_update` emit additions (agents.stop, regenerate-insights, insights success, mark_read, tasks.dispatch, dispatcher notify_at, retry-summary, suggestions) that caused redundant/incorrect updates.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Long-press multi-select unified** across every list surface — Inbox tasks, Agent rows, Project tiles, agent rows inside a project's detail page, Trash rows. Long-press pre-selects the pressed item.
- Bulk action bars per surface: Inbox (AI batch-process / Start / Delete); Agents and ProjectDetailPage agent list (mark Read / Stop / Delete); Projects (Activate / Archive / Delete with uniform-state enabledness); Trash (Restore / permanently Delete).
- One-shot startup backfill in `database.py` promoting `parent_id`-set rows with `is_subagent=0` to `1`, protecting against future drift.

### Changed

- Selected card state unified across surfaces: `ring-2 ring-cyan-500/50 brightness-[0.88]` with a 400ms `cubic-bezier(0.22,1.15,0.36,1)` transition that includes the `filter` property.
- Bulk-bar buttons now share size, layout, and disabled treatment (`flex-1 min-h-[40px]` icon-buttons, `disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed`); Agents' Delete switched from `bg-red-900` to the standard `bg-red-600`.
- Select-mode header bars use a 3-col grid (Select All / N selected / Done) for a centered middle label.
- README's Gestures & Shortcuts section documents long-press → multi-select and the per-surface bulk actions.

### Fixed

- `GET /api/projects/{name}/agents` was missing the `Agent.is_subagent == False` filter — subagents could appear in a project's agent list until they hit the SubagentStop hook.

### Removed

- Per-card check-circle indicator on Agents and Projects (the ring + darkening is the single visual language).
- Clipboard-icon toggle button from the Inbox and Agents top bars (long-press is the sole entry point).

## [0.8.2] - 2026-04-26

### Changed

- `WorktreePill` interaction model now matches the `xylo id` pill: hover (mouse) opens the popover, long-press (touch) opens it, double-click copies. Outside `pointerdown` closes; popover hover cancels the close timer.
- Both the `xylo id` and `worktree` popovers gain an upward arrow rendered after content so it paints over the seam to form a continuous shape.
- Replaced popover drop-shadow with a reusable `.shadow-popover` utility (`0 4px 20px @ 14%` below + `0 -1px 6px @ 6%` above) — softer macOS-style halo matching the existing `.glass-bar` aesthetic.

### Removed

- Insights-status tags (`failed` / `generating` / `insights`) from the chat-page top bar; the dedicated insights surface remains the source of truth.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- New shared `WorktreePill` component: icon-only purple chip; single-click expands a centered popover showing `worktree: <name>` plus a Copy button. Used in `AgentRow` (Agents page + Project detail), `InboxCard`, and the `AgentChatPage` header — chat list / project page / agents list / inbox / chat header now share the same compact tag.

### Changed

- Trigger uses `span` + `role="button"` so it nests inside the AgentRow card button without invalid HTML.

### Removed

- Dark/light theme toggle from the chat-page icon toolbar; theme toggle remains available on Inbox, Agents, Projects, Monitor, Tasks, Git, Trash, Split, and New pages. The chat-page toolbar is now scoped to agent-specific actions (refresh / browse / mute / defer).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- New row 2 in the chat header hosts task and agent-id as interactive pills. ID pill is labelled `id` (4 chars, sized for tap targets); hover or long-press shows a portal-rendered popover (escapes `overflow-x` clipping, centered under the pill, prefixed `xylo id:`); double-click copies.

### Changed

- Tags collapsed onto a single line; action buttons (Stop/Resume/OK) replaced with an icon toolbar in tinted style.
- Status dot moved next to the title, matching `AgentRow` card spacing and the running-pulse on `ProjectsPage`.
- Tag row aligned with the card-list visual style.

### Removed

- Noisy chips: `model`, `effort`, `tmux`, and the `deferred` chip (which now also auto-hides once the defer time has passed).
- Native `title` tooltip on the ID pill (avoid duplicate-popover flicker); the overlay that used to intercept hover/dblclick was removed.

### Fixed

- Monitor health chip restored after an earlier drop.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- Telemetry `daily_heartbeat` was reporting `v0.6.1` after the v0.7.0 release because `_load_version()` read the root `package.json` (the `create-xylocopa` npm installer's own version), which the v0.7.0 release commit didn't bump. Version source switched to `frontend/package.json` — release flow already bumps that on every tag, so heartbeat version stays in sync automatically going forward.

### Changed

- Sent-bubble check icon brightened from `gray-400/50` to `gray-100/80`; sent bubble matches delivered colour while the grey check distinguishes the two states.

### Removed

- Stale refactor plan docs and references to them in source comments.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Anonymous `daily_heartbeat` telemetry (one event/day, gated to >20h interval) sent to a Cloudflare Worker that writes to a private D1 database. No IPs, no user content. Opt-out via the Monitor page toggle, `XYLOCOPA_TELEMETRY=0`, or `telemetry: false` in `~/.xylocopa/config.yaml`. See `## Telemetry` in README and [`orchestrator/telemetry.py`](orchestrator/telemetry.py).
- Defer agent: hide an agent from the main list and mute its notifications until a chosen time. Collapsible "Deferred" section on the Agents page. Defer chip uses an hourglass icon in both the inbox card and chat header.
- Per-message bubble menu in chat with Copy / Modify / Delete actions.

### Changed

- **Pre-delivery refactor.** Messages now flow PENDING → pre-delivered → sent → delivered. Dispatcher promotes pre-delivery → sent atomically on tmux send; display file uses read-before-truncate rebuild; sync content-matching is restricted to sent-state DB rows. WebSocket emits `predelivery_*` and `message_sent` events; frontend chat bubbles render the new state machine.
- DELETE is now single-step (tombstones queued/scheduled rows immediately) and ESC does soft-cancel through a separate endpoint — they no longer share behavior.
- SessionStart hook is the canonical launch-wake signal. JSONL polling fallback removed from the launch path; orchestrator waits on the hook.
- `/compact` and `/clear` slash-commands emit `message_executed` on completion; web slash-command rows are matched against their `<command-message>` JSONL wrapper instead of creating duplicate CLI rows.
- `datetime-local` inputs in the frontend prefill in the local timezone rather than UTC.
- README hero rewritten ("Many projects. One attention."), install simplified to a curl one-liner, GTD framing added.
- Tmux launch poll tightened to 200 ms; `TUI_SETTLE_DELAY` reduced from 3 s to 0.5 s.

### Fixed

- `cancel_message` is idempotent when the row is already `CANCELLED`.
- Tmux send no longer breaks on messages that begin with `-`.
- DB fallback no longer leaks `CANCELLED` messages back into display output.
- Duplicate pre-delivery bubble and out-of-order Attempts panel in chat.
- First message after orchestrator startup is synced immediately rather than waiting for the next tick.
- Sync engine restores task-launched rows to the match-candidate pool so they don't get orphaned.

### Removed

- Dead `/messages` endpoint and stale `emit_message_update(CANCELLED)` WS event.
- `XY_QUEUED_FALLBACK` scaffolding (Phase 3 cleanup of the predelivery migration).
- Unreachable partial-output salvage path in the dispatcher and the corresponding README claim.
- Telegram notification claims from docs (the integration was never implemented).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- Agent chat back button returns to the originating page (project detail or Agents list) instead of always going to a default.
- Inlined the back chevron into the project header so the title and nav share a single row.
- Pinned the project detail `FilterTabs` to the header, matching the sticky behavior of `AgentsPage`.
- Agent → orchestrator callbacks switched from the HTTP token channel to MCP tools; legacy callback token path removed.
- `session_source_dir()` now resolves `project_path` via `realpath`, fixing symlinked-project edge cases (follow-up to the `ef07c26` /clear rotation fix).
- Bumped `package.json` version to `0.6.1` (was stuck at `0.4.1` across v0.5.0 and v0.6.0).

### Removed

- In-project "New Agent" card — the New Task sheet is now the sole entry point for creating agents inside a project.
- Reverted the folders-endpoint union change while keeping `reconcile.py` (the union broke a downstream consumer; reconciliation logic is preserved).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Resume hint** — per-project LLM-generated mood + recap card on each project tile. Anchored to three signals (task name, latest user intent, last 8 turns) so the recap doesn't drift into whatever tangent happened most recently. Regenerated on the stop hook.
- New Fluent UI Emoji set for project cards (`ProjectRing` + `FluentEmoji` components, MIT-licensed, jsdelivr CDN with system-emoji fallback). Inline emoji editor wired into both `ProjectsPage` and `ProjectDetailPage`.
- Day/week toggle on the time-badge popover.
- New delete action on cancelled message bubbles.
- Beginner getting-started guide (en + zh).

### Changed

- ~54× reduction in token consumption for MCP cross-session references.
- Pipeline-order status bar replaces the stat text strip — color-coded by task status.
- Compact single-row project strip; dropped the progress ring around the icon.
- "Task" toggle defaults to ON when creating new agents.
- Persist the voice transcription/refine pipeline in IndexedDB so it survives page reloads. `keepalive: true` on transcribe/refine fetches; `MediaRecorder.start(1000)` timeslice for long recordings.
- Inject a short-TTL `XYLOCOPA_AGENT_TOKEN` into spawned tmux agents; harden tmux create + use the worktree cwd on agent resume.
- `realpath` worktree paths in session JSONL resolution; triage meta-agent sessions attributed to the self-host project.
- `archive` blocked while sessions are active; tasks are unassigned rather than cancelled.

### Fixed

- Race where unmounting the recorder deleted its IndexedDB entry mid-flush.
- Pending interactive cards now dismiss on ESC / interrupt.

### Removed

- Git-remote chip from project cards and agent/task counts from the project detail header.
- Active Agents section from the Monitor page.
- Frustrated-face emojis from the resume-hint mood palette; re-added 🤯 as "mind-blown".

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- New `UnreadProvider` centralizing per-agent unread counts on the WebSocket event stream (`agent_update`), with HTTP resync on WS (re)connect. BottomNav Agents badge, FAB, and PWA app badge render from one source — no more 5s poll divergence.
- `AttentionButton` (renamed from the split-screen FAB): draggable, turns into a cyan unread total when any agent has new messages, tap jumps to oldest-unread (FIFO), long-press opens split screen.
- Viewing-time stats popover on the Projects header, aligned with the Weekly Success Rate layout. Press-and-hold a daily bar reveals its duration; a dim duration label sits above every bar so magnitudes are readable without interaction.
- Per-project session viewing time tracking (powers the new popover).

### Changed

- `/compact` handling: drain pending JSONL turns in `PreCompact` before pausing sync, and defer the single-check until after the drain completes.
- `mark_delivered` on slash-command delivery transitions `QUEUED → EXECUTING` and emits a `message_update` event so the UI can drop muted "pending" styling.
- `agent_update` WS payload now carries `unread_count` and message preview.
- Push fanout is fire-and-forget so it doesn't block the event loop.
- Restart-button reload wipes the service worker and caches before reloading.
- Installer prints a system-package-manager install hint instead of auto-invoking `sudo`.
- Monochrome cyan palette + roomier tooltip on the viewing-time popover; viewing-time ring replaced by a duration pill.

### Removed

- "All Tasks" section from the Weekly SR popover and the project-detail SR popover; percentage text stripped from popover numbers (first-attempt + daily sparkline labels keep them).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Orchestrator startup `WARNING` if any `frontend/src` file is newer than `frontend/dist/index.html`, making stale-build deploys visible immediately.
- Reload-storm detector that piggybacks on the reload-trace beacon and logs `ERROR` when a single client IP triggers ≥5 patch-failed reloads in a 60s window.
- New git `post-commit` hook auto-rebuilds `frontend/dist` when a commit touches `frontend/*` (excluding `dist/`, `node_modules/`, `dev-dist/`); serialized via `flock`, installed through `tools/install-git-hooks.sh`.
- Navigation and API timing console logs to aid client-side perf debugging.

### Changed

- `install.js` runs the step-1 dependency check before `git clone`, so users without `git` get the auto-installer guidance instead of a raw clone failure.
- pm2 → systemd migration: `install.js` prompts for auto-start independently of "start now"; `run.sh restart` refreshes `dump.pm2` so boot-time resurrect matches current config.
- npm package version aligned with the git tag (was stuck at 1.0.0).

### Fixed

- New-agent card overflow on the project detail page — Model/Effort pills now wrap inside the card on narrow viewports instead of pushing the right-side toggles off-screen.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Jump-to-Unread FAB.** The split-screen FAB morphs into a cyan unread-count badge when any agent has new messages; tap jumps to the oldest unread (FIFO), long-press always opens split screen.
- New `GET /api/agents/unread-list` endpoint returns unread agents sorted oldest-first.
- New `tools/push_reset.py` — interactive picker that sends a remote SW-reset push to a specific device, unblocking PWAs wedged on a stale bundle.

### Changed

- Badge updates are event-driven over WebSocket (`new_message` / `agent_update`) with 150ms debounce; 5s poll kept as a reconnect safety net.
- `_send_webpush` fans subscribers out through a 16-thread pool instead of looping serially; total time `sum(rtt)` (~2.5s across 11 subscribers) → `max(rtt)` (~250ms).
- ESC button now triggers `wake_sync` so the cancelled-bubble state lands in the UI without waiting for the next poll tick. `loadData` defers 150ms after ESC wake-sync so the refresh lands after the sync pass.
- Cancelled message bubbles render with a gray background.
- Service-worker auto-reload disabled to break an iOS PWA reload loop. Cache-buster `CV` bumped v2 → v3 to force stuck PWAs to unregister the old SW.
- `./run.sh restart` and `/api/system/restart` auto-rebuild stale `frontend/dist/` before restarting. Vite dev → `vite preview` in production to avoid HMR-reconnect white screens.
- README hero slimmed to a single bold tagline; jump-to-unread FAB added to the Monitor feature list.

### Fixed

- `sync_engine` stop-hook branch emits `agent_update` immediately after the unread bump instead of waiting for the full turn import + push fanout.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- New skill picker panel in the chat input — frequency-sorted, slash-triggered, scans both `~/.claude/skills/` and per-project `.claude/commands/` markdown.
- Decoupled skill enumeration into its own module (`skills.py`) with per-project cache and parser folding.
- Hybrid allowlist + `KNOWN_PROBLEMATIC` blocklist for slash-command gating.
- Per-agent tab title and favicon (hue derived from agent ID, skipping the blue band).
- Permission-mode segmented three-way switch (Normal / Auto / Plan), synced to `agent.skip_permissions`.
- New `xhigh` effort level for Opus 4.7 CLI (between `high` and `max`).

### Changed

- Queued messages cancelled by the user are soft-cancelled — the row stays in the DB with `CANCELLED` status, the bubble greys in place rather than disappearing.
- `Esc` bulk-cancels all active queued messages.
- `dispatch_pending_message` gained a busy guard — refresh / wake-sync no longer send-keys into an `EXECUTING` pane.
- `_stop_generating` auto-dispatches the next `PENDING` message on every `EXECUTING → IDLE` transition.
- Streaming poll tightened to 100ms; permission re-check stays at ~30s.
- `.mcp.json` uses an absolute venv python path so MCP works regardless of CWD.
- Open agent chat in a new tab from list views.
- README repositioned around AI-native GTD; surfaces crash-recovery and durability properties.

### Fixed

- `/plugin` blocked because the TUI marketplace UI never fires `UserPromptSubmit`, leaving messages wedged.
- `<command-message>` wrapper filtered from chat history (universal slash-command JSONL injection that lacks `isMeta`).
- `AuthGuard` recovers softly when the backend reconnects instead of forcing a full reload.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- `create_task` MCP tool — any Claude Code session can drop a task into the inbox without DB scripts or auth navigation. Reuses the `TaskCreate` Pydantic schema; `project` is optional and falls back to longest-prefix `cwd` match against `projects.path`.
- README "Durable by Default" section with source-linked bullets covering session cache, unlimited retention, partial-output salvage, tmux-anchored recovery, resume, backups, draft persistence, session-dir migration, orphan cleanup. Features table renamed "Backups" → "Reliability & Recovery".
- Reload-trace probe: every reload trigger (SW `controllerchange`, explicit `location.reload()`, vite HMR full-reload, iOS background kill) is logged via `sendBeacon` to `/api/debug/auth-diag`.

### Changed

- `AuthGuard` performs soft recovery on server reconnect instead of full page reload.
- `location.reload` override installed in `<head>` (before any ES module) detects vite-originated reloads via stack trace and suppresses them — works around vite HMR client reloading on every WS reconnect.
- `/api/debug/frontend-state` gated behind a localStorage flag.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- **Rebrand AgentHive → Xylocopa.** Backend renamed with `agenthive` compat shims; frontend rebrand with localStorage migration (`agenthive_*` → `xylo_*`); CLI / installer / scripts renamed (`ah` → `xy`). Tmux pane prefix switched to `xy-{agent_id[:8]}`; legacy `ah-` sessions still recognized. GitHub repo moved to `jyao97/xylocopa`. Bee mascot (carpenter bee, *Xylocopa*) replaces robot icon; PWA icons regenerated.
- LaTeX math rendering via KaTeX in the chat view.
- Media file extraction from tool-usage entries (absolute paths supported) for inline preview.
- All images render via `FileAttachments` thumbnails; inline duplicates suppressed.
- Agent cards redesigned to match Inbox style — tag pills, single-line preview truncation. Hollow status ring with radiating glow for executing; cyan-family palette for idle/stopped. Drag-and-drop reordering with `sort_order` column migration.
- FloatingTaskCard redesigned with structured metadata layout and InboxCard-style tag pills. Note module added (markdown rendering, no border). **Quick Note** renamed from Notes — personal memo, not model input.
- Unlock screen redesigned as horizontal liquid-glass card.

### Fixed

- Stuck `pendingSendRef` causing auto-send after failed upload.
- Deferred-send decoupled from text changes via refs.
- File browser localStorage scoped per-agent-session; stale project-scoped keys cleared.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- LaTeX math rendering — chat messages now render LaTeX formulas via KaTeX. Block math (`$$...$$`) displays as centered equations; inline math (`$...$`) renders within text. Requires at least one LaTeX marker (`\`, `{`, `^`, `_`) to avoid false positives with currency symbols.
- Tool-usage media extraction — file paths mentioned in tool calls (e.g. `Read /path/to/image.png`) are detected and displayed as media previews in the following text bubble.
- Known Issues section in the README documenting iPad and mobile-browser layout caveats.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- macOS support: process detection (`pgrep`/`ps`) moved into a platform abstraction layer; macOS Keychain support for Claude credential reading; NFC Unicode normalization and CWD fallback for JSONL path resolution on APFS; Bash 3.2 quoting fix in `session-start.sh`. iOS CA certificate install guide, Web Clip profile generation, mkcert CA root support.
- Cross-session MCP — agents read other agents' conversation history via `"check ah session <session_id>"`.
- Retry-adjusted stats: progress metrics account for retried tasks; unified formula across TaskRing, weekly rate, and daily sparkline.
- Timezone support for daily/weekly stats.
- Task toggle on agent creation forms — optionally create a tracked task when launching an agent.
- Gestures documented: double-tap to copy session IDs and messages.

### Changed

- Viewport: `h-dvh` → `fixed inset-0` migration for iOS Safari bottom gap; `overscroll-behavior` to prevent rubber-band scroll breaking layout.
- Import retry with loading fallback for iOS PWA background resume; split-screen `h-dvh`/`h-screen` inconsistency fix.
- Unified split-screen and single-screen navigation bar layout.
- File browser converted from full-screen modal to bottom sheet with cached state.
- Code copy button always visible on mobile, hover on desktop. Scrollable code blocks and tables inside chat bubbles.
- Chat bubble width tuned to `min(85%, 30rem)`.
- Push notification taps preserve split-screen mode.
- `skipWaiting` + `clientsClaim` for instant Service Worker updates.

### Fixed

- Orphaned tmux sessions properly killed on agent stop.
- Page navigation lag (polls no longer restart on every route change).
- Rate-limit-options menu auto-dismiss after rate limit clears.

### Removed

- Broken Agents-by-Status card and redundant Claude Processes card from Monitor.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **Session detection simplification.** Replaced 4-strategy `_discover_session_id_from_pane()` fallback chain with a single `SessionStart` hook path. The hook now writes `session_id` at entry creation time; the adopt endpoint reads it directly without discovery.

### Removed

- Multi-strategy discovery (file descriptor scanning, JSONL freshness-window matching, `/tmp/ahive-pending-sessions/` signal mechanism, shell script offline fallback).

### Added

- Commit-safety rules added to `CLAUDE.md` (no secrets, no certs, no personal paths, no database files).
