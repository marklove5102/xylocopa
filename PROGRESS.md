### 2026-02-23 | Task: Phase 1 Scheduler Core (1.1–1.4) | Status: success

### What was done
- **1.1 Database Schema**: models.py (Task, Project, SystemConfig tables), database.py (SQLite WAL mode, session factory), config.py (env vars)
- **1.2 FastAPI CRUD**: Full task lifecycle (create/list/get/cancel/retry), project listing, enhanced health check, Pydantic schemas, registry.yaml loading on startup
- **1.3 Worker Manager**: Subprocess lifecycle management — start/stop/logs/status/cleanup, resource limits
- **1.4 Task Dispatcher**: Async scheduling loop with harvest/timeout/retry/assign phases, startup crash recovery, concurrency limits (global + per-project)

### Problems encountered
- Test tasks kept retrying because .env has placeholder API keys

### Solutions
- Cancelled test tasks manually; auto-retry stops at MAX_RETRIES=3

### Lessons learned
- SQLAlchemy `expire_on_commit=False` is essential for reading task fields after commit in the same session
- SQLite WAL mode + `check_same_thread=False` needed for async dispatcher + sync API sharing the same DB
- `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` instead of `datetime.utcnow()` to avoid naive datetime comparison issues

### 2026-02-24 | Task: Session Persistence + Auth Simplification | Status: success

### What was done
1. **Session persistence**: Session files and refreshed tokens survive restarts. `--resume` works across restarts.
2. **Auth simplification**: Switched to `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` env var (generated via `claude setup-token`, valid ~1 year). Simplified credential management.

### Problems encountered
- `plan_manager.py` (since removed) also imported old config vars — missed on first pass

### Solutions
- Updated all module imports alongside worker_manager.py

### Lessons learned
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is the officially recommended auth method — eliminates credential file management entirely
- When removing config vars, grep the entire codebase for imports — not just the file you're working on
- Plan mode was later removed entirely (commit ad1c2c9) — only INTERVIEW and AUTO modes remain

### 2026-02-26 | Task: Worktree Session Resolution + tmux Recovery | Status: success

### What was done

**Worktree session directory resolution (critical bug fix)**
- Claude Code stores session JSONL files based on the CWD where it launched, not the project root
- Worktree agents launch from `{project}/.claude/worktrees/{name}/`, so their sessions end up in a completely different `~/.claude/projects/` subdirectory
- Created `_resolve_session_jsonl(session_id, project_path, worktree)` helper that checks both project root and worktree session dirs
- Fixed **13 call sites** across agent_dispatcher.py that used `session_source_dir(project_path)` directly:
  - `_dispatch_pending_messages()` — resume pre-check
  - `_sync_session_loop_inner()` — session parsing
  - `import_session_history()` — history import
  - `_reap_dead_agents()` — liveness freshness check
  - `_detect_successor_session()` — scans both session dirs for successors
  - `_spawn_successor_agent()` — new session parsing
  - `_dedup_pane_agents()` — mtime comparison
  - `_recover_agents()` — recovery JSONL path + liveness
  - `_auto_detect_cli_sessions()` — scans worktree session dirs + Tier 0 agent lookup

**tmux recovery pane assignment (critical bug fix)**
- On server restart, `_recover_agents()` re-detects tmux panes for each agent
- `_detect_tmux_pane_for_session()` filters out panes owned by non-STOPPED agents via `_get_pane_owner()`
- During recovery, agents' OWN panes get filtered (they're non-STOPPED), making them match wrong panes
- Multiple agents got assigned the same pane → dedup conflict → one agent force-stopped
- Fix: Use tmux session name `ah-{agent_id[:8]}` for definitive matching (built `session_name_to_pane` dict once at startup)

**CWD matching for worktree agents (bug fix)**
- 4 locations used exact `cwd == project_path` comparison
- Worktree agent CWDs like `{project}/.claude/worktrees/streaming` failed this check
- Fix: subdirectory matching `cwd == proj or cwd.startswith(proj + "/")`

**Auto-detect Tier 0 matching (enhancement)**
- `_auto_detect_cli_sessions()` used PID/session-file matching, which sometimes picked the wrong stopped agent
- Added Tier 0: if tmux session name is `ah-{id}`, directly look up that agent by ID prefix

**Schema/API fixes**
- Added `session_id` to `AgentOut` and `AgentBrief` schemas
- Added `AgentStatus.SYNCING` to active agent count queries
- Added `metadata` column to messages table (migration in database.py)

### Problems encountered
1. Worktree agent had 5 messages from wrong session file (looked correct because first message happened to match)
2. Pane dedup caused silent agent termination on every restart
3. Wrong agent revived by auto-detect when multiple stopped agents existed for same project
4. `session_source_dir()` was called in 13+ places, each one a potential worktree bug

### Solutions
1. Created unified `_resolve_session_jsonl()` that checks both dirs, then did a comprehensive audit of ALL call sites
2. Used tmux session name as authoritative pane→agent mapping (not PID/session heuristics)
3. Added Tier 0 matching in auto-detect using tmux session name
4. Systematic grep + fix of every `session_source_dir()` call site

### Lessons learned
- **Claude Code session directory isolation**: Sessions are stored under `~/.claude/projects/{path-encoded-cwd}/`. Worktree CWD differs from project root → different directory. This is the #1 source of bugs for worktree features.
- **tmux session names are authoritative**: `ah-{agent_id[:8]}` is more reliable than any PID/file heuristic for pane matching. Always prefer session name matching over other methods.
- **Self-exclusion during recovery**: When recovering agents, their own panes appear "owned" by themselves (non-STOPPED), causing `_get_pane_owner()` to filter them out. Must handle this edge case.
- **Exact CWD matching breaks worktrees**: Always use subdirectory matching. A worktree agent's CWD is a subdirectory of the project.
- **Audit pattern**: When fixing a helper function bug, grep for ALL call sites of the old pattern. Don't assume you found them all — `session_source_dir` appeared 13+ times.
- **Wrong session file ≠ empty file**: A wrong session file can appear to work (has messages), just from a different session. Validate session IDs match, not just file existence.

### 2026-02-26 | Task: Notification + Streaming Investigation | Status: success

### What was done
- Audited all 6 `send_push_notification` call sites — **all are properly guarded** with `_is_agent_in_use()` check
- `_is_agent_in_use()` checks both WebSocket viewing state and tmux `session_attached`
- `_refresh_pane_attached()` runs tmux query and caches results in `_pane_attached` dict
- Verified tmux shows `session_attached=1` for active panes

### Still investigating
- Notification suppression may have race condition: `_refresh_pane_attached()` is called at start of dispatcher loop, but notification decisions happen later — if tmux state changes between calls, stale data could cause false notifications
- Streaming visibility may be intermittent due to sync loop timing or WebSocket connection state

### 2026-03-03 | Task: Task System v2 + Subagent Tracking + Multi-bugfix | Status: success

### What was done

**Task system v2 improvements**
- Added `GET /api/v2/tasks/counts` endpoint — perspective-based counts (queue/executing/review/done) + weekly completion stats
- Added `_get_session_slug()` for detecting `/clear` transitions via slug matching (increased search depth from 5→20 lines)
- Fixed `_get_session_pid()` to fall through on dead PIDs instead of early return
- Integrated task stats into MonitorContext (30s polling) + wired into PageHeader
- State machine: added `InvalidTransitionError`, expanded valid transitions (EXECUTING→COMPLETE, etc.)
- WebSocket reconnect: seed `generating_agents` on reconnect
- Legacy dispatcher: skip v2 tasks in legacy dispatcher loop
- New UI components: EffortSelector, ModelSelector, PromptInputBar, DoneView DONE_COMPLETED count

**Subagent detection and tracking (2a26146)**
- Claude Code spawns subagents (Explore, Plan, etc.) — now detected and tracked
- Scans `{session_dir}/subagents/agent-*.jsonl` for subagent metadata
- Creates lightweight Agent records with `parent_id` and `is_subagent=True`
- Imports subagent conversation turns into Messages
- API: subagents filtered from main list, attached to parent detail view, cascade stop

**Successor detection after ExitPlanMode /clear (56614ed)**
- `_get_session_pid()` only matched `.claude.json.tmp.{PID}` pattern
- After `/clear`, new sessions may only write source code tmp files (e.g. `main.py.tmp.{PID}.{ts}`)
- Added broader fallback matching any `{file}.tmp.{PID}.{timestamp}` pattern
- Fixed agents stuck in SYNCING forever after "clear context & bypass"
- **Root cause investigation** (5 parallel agents): primary cause was silent sync loop death at line 4323 (`if not agent or agent.status != AgentStatus.SYNCING: break`) — NO logging on this exit path. Secondary: 57-second blind spot between `/clear` and first `.tmp` file write
- Slug-based matching added as PID-independent fallback (slug persists across `/clear`)

**Invalid model name fix (90e7ec1)**
- `registry.yaml` loader used hardcoded fallback `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514` — not a valid model ID
- Added `VALID_MODELS` set in config.py, validation in create_agent/launch/load_registry
- Startup migration to fix 10 projects + 4 agents with invalid models in live DB

**Other bug fixes (via worktree agents)**
- Fix project task counts: use Task table instead of Message counts (ca303be)
- Fix back button unclickable when toast overlaps (2104949) — z-index issue
- Fix voice auto-start broken by React StrictMode double-mount (93cd06d)
- Auto-stop agent after merge task completes (ae5b16e) — was left in IDLE state

### Problems encountered
1. Session slug search only scanned first 5 lines — insufficient for some sessions
2. Dead PID in `_get_session_pid()` caused early return → successor never found
3. Hardcoded invalid model name propagated to 10 projects silently
4. Merge task completion left agents in IDLE without cleanup

### Lessons learned
- **Model validation at boundaries**: Always validate model names on input (create/launch/load), not just output. Add a `VALID_MODELS` set and check against it.
- **Slug-based session matching**: After `/clear`, session IDs change but the slug (human-readable session name) persists. Slug matching is more robust than PID matching for detecting session continuity.
- **Subagent lifecycle**: Claude Code subagents write to `{session_dir}/subagents/agent-{uuid}.jsonl`. They have their own session IDs and conversation turns. Must parse these separately from the parent session.
- **Worktree agent delegation works**: 6 bug fixes were completed by worktree agents in parallel — the merge-and-stop lifecycle is now reliable enough for routine fixes.

### 2026-03-03 (afternoon) | Task: UI Features + Task Stats + Try/Revert | Status: success

### What was done

**Task stats popover + daily success rate chart**
- Fixed `popRef` undefined error in `TaskStatsPopover` (caused crash on ring click)
- Increased popover card min-width from 220→260px to prevent number line-break
- Added `/api/v2/tasks/counts` `daily` field — returns 7-day `total`/`completed`/`success_pct` per day
- Pure SVG sparkline chart (no charting lib) with gradient fill, percentage labels, single-letter weekday
- Per-project task ring on ProjectsPage — 22px Apple Watch style ring in card top-right
- Backend: folders endpoint added `task_completed` field, fixed `Task.project` → `Task.project_name`

**Task completion notifications + global toggles (0bf81bb)**
- Push notification on task COMPLETE/FAILED
- Global mute toggle in settings

**Try It / Revert It buttons for branch preview (0d56a46, 64f7f5e, 7b78010)**
- Try Changes: merges task branch into main temporarily, saves `try_base_commit` for rollback
- Revert Try: `git reset --hard {try_base_commit}`, creates backup branch first for non-worktree tasks
- Unified logic for worktree and non-worktree tasks
- Review page: fixed button text wrapping, renamed to clearer labels

**Muted bell icon fix**
- Replaced distorted muted bell SVG in 3 files (TasksPage, AgentsPage, AgentChatPage) with clean bell + diagonal slash

**Bottom nav review count badge**
- Tasks tab shows orange badge with REVIEW count (polls `/api/v2/tasks/counts` every 10s)

**Double-tap to scroll to unread (WeChat-style)**
- Agents tab: double-tap scrolls to first unread agent, cyan highlight flash 1.5s
- Tasks tab: double-tap switches to Review tab, scrolls to first review task
- Uses custom `nav-scroll-to-unread` event + `data-agent-id`/`data-task-id` attributes

### 2026-03-03 (afternoon) | Task: Agent In-Use / Notification Hardening | Status: in-progress (uncommitted)

### What was done (edits applied but NOT committed)

**WebSocket viewing state fragility (HIGH)**
- `sendWsMessage` silently dropped viewing messages when WS not OPEN
- Fix: added `viewingAgentRef` that persists across reconnects and replays on `ws.onopen`
- Tab visibility gating: hidden tab should not suppress notifications

**`unread_count` not guarded (MEDIUM)**
- 4 sites in `agent_dispatcher.py` incremented `unread_count` without checking `_is_agent_in_use`
- Fix: added guards matching the push notification pattern

**Agent not stopped on terminal task transitions (HIGH)**
- Non-worktree approve left agent in IDLE state
- Cancel from REVIEW didn't stop agent (guard only checked EXECUTING/MERGING)
- Fix: added agent stop + tmux kill on all terminal transitions

**IDLE counted as "active" (MEDIUM)**
- Frontend Active tabs and backend stats included IDLE agents
- Fix: excluded IDLE alongside STOPPED

**tmux_pane = None race (MEDIUM)**
- Line 4759 set `agent.tmux_pane = None`, line 4775 passed it to `_is_agent_in_use` (always None)
- Fix: saved pane reference before nulling

**Dead config removed**
- `MAX_IDLE_AGENTS` defined but never used

### NOTE
These changes remain uncommitted on master. They were applied across 3 interactive sessions.

### 2026-03-03 (afternoon) | Task: Hardening Sprint | Status: success

### What was done

**CORS security (af9a435)**
- Replaced `allow_origins=["*"]` with configurable `CORS_ORIGINS` env var
- Default: `["http://localhost:5173"]` (dev only)

**Backend unit tests (4eab247)**
- 64 comprehensive tests added
- Fixed broken mixed content assertion in FilePreview tests

**Constants dedup (4254163, ffbbbbf)**
- Frontend: extracted magic numbers to `constants.js`
- Backend: extracted magic numbers to module-level constants in `main.py`

**Schema/code cleanup (312ba81, 8fdf930, 0216e82)**
- Deduplicated `AgentBrief`/`AgentOut` in `schemas.py`
- Cleaned up `agent_dispatcher.py`
- Extracted `PRAGMA table_info` helper in `database.py`

### 2026-03-03 (evening) | Task: Release Prep Assessment + Bug Fixes | Status: success

### What was done

**Release preparation assessment (RELEASE_PREP.md)**
- Full codebase audit for OSS release readiness
- Identified Linux-only code paths (`/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/loadavg`) — macOS compat blocker
- Missing deps: `python-dotenv`, `requests`, `psutil` not in `requirements.txt`
- Missing files: `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `install.sh`, `scripts/`
- Package name still `"vite-temp"` in `package.json`
- No CI/CD pipeline (no `.github/` directory)
- `ca.pem` and personal paths in git history
- `.env.example` missing `CORS_ORIGINS`, `DISABLE_AUTH`, `HOST_CLAUDE_DIR` vars
- Still unfixed from prior audit: `_detectPlanIdx()` defaults to index 0 on parse failure (P0 safety)

**Make task merging synchronous (dd9e0e4)**
- Approve was launching an unnecessary agent for `git merge --no-ff`
- Changed to direct synchronous git merge (completes in <100ms)
- Conflict handling: auto `git merge --abort` → task status CONFLICT

**Successor "Continued →" link bug fix**
- `_compute_successor_id` found sub-agents via `parent_id` — sub-agent mistakenly shown as successor
- Fix: added `Agent.is_subagent == False` filter in `_compute_successor_id`
- Same fix in `resume_agent` — sub-agents were blocking resume of parent agent

**Replace robot icons with folder icons (11c2683)**
- ProjectsPage: robot → folder icons for project cards

**Reject task orphan agent fix**
- Rejecting a task left the old agent running (orphan process)
- Now: reject stops agent (STOPPED status + kill tmux session) before setting task REJECTED

**Worktree unconditional creation bug (in d2e7204)**
- `_create_task_agent()` always created worktree regardless of user toggle
- Added `use_worktree` field to Task model, `TaskCreate`/`TaskOut` schemas, DB migration
- 6 files changed: models, schemas, database, main, agent_dispatcher, NewTaskPage

**TaskStatus enum typo (HTTP 500)**
- `TaskStatus.COMPLETED` used but enum defines `TaskStatus.COMPLETE`
- Crashed `GET /api/projects` → both Git page and Create Task page returned 500
- Lesson: enum member names must exactly match — no auto-completion inference

### Problems encountered
1. `popRef` undefined caused silent crash on popover click — React didn't show useful error
2. Merging via agent was unnecessary overhead for a simple `git merge --no-ff`
3. Sub-agents shared `parent_id` with real successors → ambiguous queries
4. Reject didn't stop the associated agent → orphan processes accumulated
5. Worktree toggle on frontend had no effect — backend ignored it
6. `COMPLETED` vs `COMPLETE` enum typo caused cascading HTTP 500s

### Lessons learned
- **Enum member names are exact**: `TaskStatus.COMPLETED` ≠ `TaskStatus.COMPLETE`. Always grep for the enum definition before using a status value. Consider adding a linter or test that validates all enum references.
- **Sub-agent vs successor disambiguation**: Both use `parent_id` but serve different purposes. Always filter `is_subagent == False` when looking for real successors. This applies to `_compute_successor_id`, `resume_agent`, and any future parent→child queries.
- **Synchronous git operations > agent-based**: For simple deterministic operations like `git merge --no-ff`, direct subprocess is better than spawning an agent. Agents are for tasks requiring intelligence/iteration.
- **Reject must clean up agent**: Any state transition that obsoletes an agent (REJECTED, CANCELLED) should stop the agent and kill its tmux session. Check all terminal transitions for cleanup.
- **Schema field propagation**: Adding a new toggle requires changes in: model → schema → DB migration → API endpoint → dispatcher logic → frontend. Missing any one link silently breaks the feature.
- **Release prep checklist**: Before OSS release: LICENSE file, install.sh, requirements.txt completeness, remove personal paths, add CI/CD, macOS compat, screenshots/demo GIF.

### 2026-03-04 (early morning) | Task: Comprehensive Tasks Module Testing | Status: success

### What was done

**89/89 API tests passed** (`test_tasks_module.py`)
- 16 test groups: creation, filtering, counts, detail, update, dispatch, cancel, reject, approve, try/revert, state machine, concurrency, edge cases, legacy v1, integrity, schema
- Test helper bug: `if body` treats `{}` as falsy — fixed to `if body is not None`

**3 parallel critic agents identified 21 issues:**

HIGH severity:
1. `completed_at` not set in FAILED paths of `_harvest_task_completions` — failed tasks excluded from weekly stats
2. No locking for concurrent git operations on same project — parallel approve/try-changes can corrupt repo
3. No row-level locking on state transitions — TOCTOU races (dispatch+cancel, approve+reject)

MEDIUM severity:
4. `try-changes` doesn't verify current branch before merging
5. `approve_task_v2` bypasses MERGING state — transition not in state machine
6. `reset --hard` in revert-try can destroy post-merge commits
7. No task-level timeout — executing tasks can run forever
8. Worktree/branch not cleaned on FAILED tasks — orphans accumulate
9. No `max_length` on description field
10. No double-click protection on list-view action buttons
11. Race condition between dismiss and submit in NewTaskPage
12. Orphaned worktrees from test dispatches (cleaned manually)

LOW severity:
13. `tmux_pane` not cleared in `reject_task_v2`
14. `auto_dispatch` with invalid project creates stuck PENDING tasks
15-21. Various frontend UX gaps (polling, pagination, keyboard access, dead code)

**20/21 fixes implemented in follow-up session:**
- Backend: `completed_at` set on all FAILED paths, `validate_transition()` in harvest, `tmux_pane` cleared on reject, main branch checkout before try-merge, commit SHA validation before `reset --hard`, project validation on auto_dispatch, `limit` capped with `Query(ge=1, le=1000)`, validation constraints on `TaskCreate`
- Frontend: loading states on dispatch/delete/reject/cancel buttons, polling stopped for terminal-state tasks, dismiss/submit race guarded with `submittingRef`, keyboard accessibility on ReviewCard, dead code removed
- 88/89 backend tests pass (1 pre-existing), 20 pre-existing frontend test failures unchanged

### Lessons learned
- **Test `if body` carefully**: Python treats `{}` as falsy. Use `if body is not None` for optional dict params.
- **Git operations need locking**: Concurrent approve/try-changes on same project can corrupt the repo. Need per-project mutex for git operations.
- **TOCTOU in state transitions**: Without row-level locking, two concurrent requests can both read REVIEW and one approves while the other rejects. Consider `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` or optimistic locking.
- **Critic agent pattern works**: Launching 3 specialized critics (backend, frontend, logs) in parallel catches issues that automated tests miss — especially architectural/design issues.

### 2026-03-04 (early morning) | Task: Plan Mode Agent Bug + Strategic Analysis | Status: success

### What was done

**Plan mode exec agent bug fix**
- Agent `717b61f5d9a8` wrote plan via `ExitPlanMode` but no follow-up agent was spawned to execute it
- Root cause: exec mode agents (`claude -p`) exit after `ExitPlanMode` auto-approve → `_harvest_completed_execs` transitions to IDLE → task goes to REVIEW. **No code path to create a follow-up agent.**
- Fix: added auto-continue logic in `_harvest_completed_execs` — detect `ExitPlanMode` in exec result metadata, create PENDING follow-up message with `source="plan_continue"` to execute the plan
- Only applies to non-`cli_sync` agents (sync agents have their own successor detection)

**Strategic gap analysis (vs Hu Yuanming's article on managing 10 Claude Code instances)**
Priority-ranked architectural gaps:
1. **Plan Mode ("review plan before execution")** — biggest gap. AgentHive executes first, reviews after. Saves 90% wasted compute when direction is wrong.
2. **Cross-task knowledge (PROGRESS.md)** — agents are "memoryless islands." Same mistakes repeated by different agents. Need shared experience injection.
3. **AI-manages-AI layer** — dispatcher is a "blind scheduler" (sees status, not content). Article uses Manager Claude for real-time monitoring.
4. **Closed-loop verification** — agents don't self-verify (no test runs, no build checks in prompts).
5. **Success rate self-optimization** — no failure pattern classification, no automatic prompt tuning.
6. **Task creation friction** — too many fields. Need "one voice command, auto-infer everything" fast path.
7. **Batch operations** — no batch approve/reject for multiple REVIEW tasks.

### Problems encountered
1. Exec mode vs sync mode lifecycle is fundamentally different — exec agents have no mechanism for successor detection or auto-continue
2. `preventDefault()` cannot be called after `await` in async click handlers — must check double-tap synchronously

### Lessons learned
- **Exec vs sync mode divergence**: Every interactive feature (ExitPlanMode, plan continuation, successor detection) needs separate handling for each mode. Exec agents exit after completion; sync agents have ongoing tmux sessions.
- **Plan Mode is highest leverage**: Reviewing a 30-second plan vs reviewing a 30-minute execution. Maps directly to the plan agent bug — system partially supports plan mode but lifecycle is broken for exec agents.
- **Inject shared knowledge into task prompts**: `_build_task_prompt()` should include PROGRESS.md or equivalent cross-task context to prevent repeated mistakes.
- **Async click handler pattern**: `preventDefault()` must happen synchronously before first `await`. Check condition synchronously, prevent immediately, then do async work.

### 2026-03-04 | Task: Pipeline test: add hello.txt | Status: success
- What: Created hello_pipeline_test.txt in project root with content "Hello from pipeline test!"
- Resolution: Straightforward file creation and commit
- Lesson: No issues — pipeline test successful

### 2026-03-04 | Task: Pipeline test: add LICENSE header | Status: success

- What: Added one-line comment header to RELEASE_PREP.md
- Resolution: Added `# This file was reviewed by pipeline test. Do NOT modify any other content.` at the top of the file
- Lesson: When Edit tool doesn't show up in git status, use bash to verify filesystem changes before assuming success

### 2026-03-04 | Task: Concurrent test 2: HIGH priority | Status: success

- What: Execute high-priority concurrent test task
- Resolution: Ran `echo task2_high_priority_done` and verified output
- Lesson: Straightforward — no issues

### 2026-03-04 | Task: Pipeline test: non-worktree echo | Status: success

- What: Run echo and date commands in non-worktree context
- Resolution: Executed `echo Pipeline test successful!` (output: "Pipeline test successful!") and `date` (output: "Wed Mar  4 02:22:33 PM PST 2026")
- Lesson: Straightforward — no issues

### 2026-03-04 | Task: Pipeline A: add test marker file | Status: success

- What: Created marker file for pipeline A test verification
- Resolution: Created `test_pipeline_marker_a.txt` with content `PIPELINE_A_MARKER_SUCCESS` and committed to master
- Lesson: Straightforward — no issues

### 2026-03-04 | Task: Concurrent test 1: normal priority | Status: success

- What: Execute normal priority concurrent test task
- Resolution: Ran `echo task1_normal_priority_done` and verified output
- Lesson: Straightforward — no issues

### 2026-03-04 | Task: Pipeline B: intentionally incomplete task | Status: success

- What: Created marker file for pipeline B test verification
- Resolution: Created `test_pipeline_marker_b.txt` with content `MARKER_B` and committed to worktree
- Lesson: Straightforward — no issues

### 2026-03-04 | Task: Pipeline test: add LICENSE header (REDO, attempt #2) | Status: success

- What: Fix incorrect LICENSE header comment in RELEASE_PREP.md
- Attempts: Previous attempt #1 added wrong wording: `# This file was reviewed by pipeline test. Do NOT modify any other content.` instead of the required `# Reviewed by AgentHive pipeline test v2.`
- Resolution: Changed comment to exact required wording: `# Reviewed by AgentHive pipeline test v2.` at top of RELEASE_PREP.md
- Lesson: Follow exact rejection feedback for wording — minor variations break requirements

### 2026-03-04 | Task: Concurrent test 3: normal priority | Status: success

- What: Execute normal priority concurrent test task
- Resolution: Ran `echo task3_normal_priority_done` and verified output
- Lesson: Straightforward — no issues

### 2026-03-04 | Task: Race test v2: double dispatch | Status: success
- What: Fixed TOCTOU race in `dispatch_task_v2` and `_dispatch_pending_tasks` using atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) pattern. Added 5 race condition tests.
- Fix: `db.query(Task).filter(Task.id == id, Task.status == expected).update(...)` instead of read-modify-write. Returns `rows == 0` when another thread already changed the status.
- Also: `_create_task_agent` now flushes instead of committing, so the caller can rollback agent+message if the CAS fails.
- Lesson: **Atomic CAS for SQLite concurrency**: `UPDATE ... WHERE status=:expected` is the correct pattern for SQLite (no row-level locks). The WHERE clause acts as a compare-and-swap — if another transaction changed the status, `rowcount == 0` and the caller knows to abort. Always flush (not commit) in sub-functions when the caller needs atomic multi-step operations.

### 2026-03-04 | Task: Dispatch flow test | Status: success

### What was done
- Added `test_dispatch_flow.py` with **59 tests** covering the full task dispatch lifecycle
- 10 test groups: dispatch endpoint, auto-dispatch, `_dispatch_pending_tasks`, `_create_task_agent`, `_build_task_prompt`, `_harvest_task_completions`, `_check_scheduled_tasks`, full flow integration, state machine edge cases, edge cases
- All 123 backend tests pass (59 new + 64 existing)

### Lessons learned
- **FK constraints in tests**: When mocking `_create_task_agent` to return an agent ID, that ID must exist in the agents table to satisfy FK constraints. Pre-create agent records before dispatch.
- **Task model defaults not set outside DB**: Creating `Task(title="X")` without `db.add()/commit()` leaves `attempt_number=None` (not the column default `1`). Always set required fields explicitly in unit tests.
- **Push module uses its own SessionLocal**: `push.send_push_notification` and `is_notification_enabled` create their own DB sessions via `SessionLocal`, which connect to a different in-memory DB in tests. Patch `push.is_notification_enabled` to `return False` to avoid this.
- **Dispatcher methods don't commit**: `_check_scheduled_tasks` relies on `_tick()` to commit at the end. When testing individual methods, call `db.commit()` after.
- **Pre-existing bug**: `GET /api/v2/tasks/{id}` detail endpoint crashes with `TaskDetailOut() got multiple values for keyword argument 'review_artifacts'` — `review_artifacts` exists in both `TaskOut` (base) and the `**TaskOut.model_validate(task).model_dump()` spread.

## 2026-03-06 — Daily Insights
1. Try/Revert has a multi-task conflict bug: if Task A is tried (merged to main) and then Task B is also tried, reverting Task A via `git reset --hard` silently rolls back Task B's merge too — `try_base_commit` of Task B now points to a dangling intermediate state.
2. Non-worktree tasks have `try_base_commit` set at agent creation time (`agent_dispatcher.py:1779`), which means the "Try" button never appears in the frontend — only "Revert" shows, creating a semantic mismatch.
3. `approve_task_v2` endpoint (`main.py:2523-2575`) fails to clear `try_base_commit` after approval; `reject_task_v2` correctly clears it at line 2605 — asymmetry bug.
4. Global `ToastContext` created (`frontend/src/contexts/ToastContext.jsx`) to replace per-page toast implementations — all pages should use `useToast()` instead of local state.
5. AgentHive vs OpenClaw differentiators: Try/Revert, Retry-with-context (feeding `agent_summary` to next attempt), and the full REVIEW→MERGING→CONFLICT merge state machine.
6. PROGRESS.md corruption by auto-summary: LLM was asked to output entire file plus new content, repeatedly truncated history — fix: generate only new section and append programmatically.
7. `_last_summary_date` was a local variable in dispatcher `run()`, reset on every restart — moved to `SystemConfig` DB table for persistence.
8. Auto-summary output validation: two guards for (1) conversational refusal markers and (2) output length <60% of original.
9. Anthropic token usage API (`/v1/oauth/usage`) returns 429 without `User-Agent` header — adding `User-Agent: claude-code/{version}` resolves it.
10. Token usage polling changed from auto 30s to manual refresh + 120s server-side cache.
11. Mobile clipboard "operation not supported" root cause: scroll-triggered `touchend` events lack browser "user activation", so `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` fails.
12. Clipboard fix: track `touchStartY`, skip double-tap if moved >10px (scroll), plus `.catch(() => {})` on all 7 `clipboard.writeText()` call sites.
13. Claude CLI image metadata text (`[Image: original NxN...]`) leaking into chat UI — `_is_image_metadata()` regex filter added to `_parse_stream_parts` and `_parse_session_turns`.
14. Orphan session JSONL cleanup: `cleanup_source_session()` added at all 4 orphan-producing code paths (session rotation, stale exhaustion, no-cache fallback, missing file at launch).
15. `permanently_delete_agent()` was missing session subdirectory and cache cleanup — updated to use `cleanup_source_session()` + `evict_session()`.
16. Session cascade bug: CWD-based detection without content verification causes agents on same project to adopt each other's sessions — content-based verification (matching first user message) added.
17. Task time properties redesigned: `scheduled_at` split into `notify_at` (push only) and `dispatch_at` (auto-dispatch to PENDING queue), with DB migration preserving existing data.
18. `_check_scheduled_tasks` rewritten into two passes: one for `notify_at` (notification) and one for `dispatch_at` (auto-dispatch).
19. Pydantic `model_fields_set` used to distinguish "field not sent" from "field explicitly set to null" in task update endpoint.
20. Split-screen uses `MemoryRouter` per pane with `RouterIsolator` wrapper (resetting `UNSAFE_LocationContext`, `UNSAFE_NavigationContext`, `UNSAFE_RouteContext`) to bypass React Router v7 nested router prohibition.
21. Cross-pane state sync uses `CustomEvent` dispatching: `agent-mute-changed`, `agent-star-changed`, `agent-renamed`, `agents-data-changed`, `projects-data-changed`.
22. `DraggableFab` uses `{right, bottom}` offsets (not absolute `{x, y}`), adapts on resize; dynamically detects fixed/sticky bottom bars via DOM measurement for `minBottom` boundary.
23. Known issue: split-screen `window.location.pathname` always returns `/split` instead of per-pane MemoryRouter path, breaking WS notification suppression logic.
24. PLANNING state is purely passive — does not auto-spawn agent or generate plan; tasks remain until manually dispatched.
25. Remaining gaps from Hu article: Plan Mode (propose before execute), closed-loop verification (Verify button spawning sub-agent), failure mode classification with auto-tuning.


## 2026-03-07 — Daily Insights
1. Claude Code v2.1.71 broke session auto-detection: debug logs (`~/.claude/debug/{session_id}.txt`) are no longer written by default, so Tier 1 PID-based matching in `_auto_detect_cli_sessions` and `_scan_for_session_jsonl` always returns `None` for new sessions.
2. Tier 2 mtime-based session detection added: when debug-log PID matching fails, match tmux panes to session JSONLs by correlating process start time (`/proc/{pid}/stat` field 22) with JSONL file creation time — picks the candidate with smallest time delta.
3. `_MAX_START_DELTA = 1800` (30 min) threshold prevents stale Claude processes (hours-old) from stealing sessions belonging to newly launched processes on the same project.
4. Random tmux sessions (non `ah-*` names) now auto-detected via Tier 2 within ~15 seconds, then tmux session is renamed to `ah-{agent_id[:8]}` for reliable future matching via Tier 0.
5. `_scan_for_session_jsonl` in `_launch_tmux_background` (main.py) also got a mtime-based fallback using `launch_start` timestamp to find the JSONL created after launch, fixing the "no session JSONL after 5 attempts" error on v2.1.71.
6. `_detectPlanIdx()` P0 safety fix: generic "yes"/"approve" now maps to index 2 (manual approval) instead of index 0 ("clear context & bypass"), preventing accidental destructive action on ambiguous user input.
7. WebSocket 403 reconnect loop root cause: `WebSocketContext.jsx` attempted connection even when `getAuthToken()` returned null, creating a permanent 403→reconnect→403 cycle that broke all real-time UI updates (messages, agent sync, streaming).
8. Duplicate pane ownership bug: agent in ERROR status retains `tmux_pane` assignment, blocking discovery loop from assigning the pane to a new SYNCING agent — ERROR agents should have `tmux_pane` cleared.
9. Dead pane in `_dispatch_tmux_pending`: when `verify_tmux_pane` fails, code clears `tmux_pane` but doesn't transition agent status — agent stays SYNCING forever with no pane, making queued messages permanently undeliverable.
10. Error-swallowing try/except audit: converted ~20 silent `except: pass/continue` blocks to `logger.warning` across `agent_dispatcher.py` (14), `websocket.py` (2), `orphan_cleanup.py` (3), and `main.py` (1) — these were hiding real failures in sync, pane detection, and cleanup paths.
11. Service Worker Workbox `NetworkFirst` caching on `/api/*` routes breaks Safari/iOS video playback: `<video>` requires HTTP Range protocol (206 Partial Content), but Workbox intercepts Range requests and returns cached full responses without `Content-Range` headers, causing `NotSupportedError`.
12. Video fix: added `NetworkOnly` route for `/api/(files|uploads)/` in `vite.config.js` `runtimeCaching`, placed after thumbnail `CacheFirst` route so `.thumb.jpg` files retain 7-day cache while video/file requests bypass SW entirely.
13. Auto-summary data source changed from "completed tasks only" to "all non-subagent agent sessions with messages that day" — ensures insights are captured even when no tasks reach COMPLETE status.
14. Auto-summary two-pass context strategy implemented: Pass 1 guarantees every session has at least a slim summary (header + first user msg + last assistant reply, each ≤1500 chars); Pass 2 distributes remaining budget evenly to expand full conversations.
15. Auto-summary deduplication: existing PROGRESS.md content (last 50K chars) is now fed to the LLM with explicit instructions to skip already-captured insights and use "Updated: X is now Y" format for corrections.
16. Auto-summary prompt changed to stdin pipe (`[CLAUDE_BIN, "-p", "-"]` with `input=prompt`) instead of CLI argument to avoid OS `ARG_MAX` limit on large session contexts (500K+ chars).
17. Auto-summary output format changed from per-session sections to flat numbered insights list with `## {date} — Daily Insights` heading, organized by conversation with `[HH:MM–HH:MM]` timestamp headers in the input context.
18. `DraggableFab` drag lag root cause: Tailwind's `transition-all` (150ms ease) was animating every `transform: translate3d()` update during drag, causing the button to "chase" the finger instead of following it — measured 61.8px average lag, reduced to 34.8px (-44%) after fix.
19. `backdrop-blur-sm` on the split-screen exit button caused GPU-intensive recomposition on every drag frame — replaced with opaque `bg-surface` background; `will-change: transform` added to promote element to its own compositing layer.
20. DraggableFab click vs drag separation: moved tap detection from `click` event to `mouseup`/`touchend` handler checking `moved` flag, then blocking all `click` events via `preventDefault` + `stopPropagation` to prevent drag-end from triggering navigation.
21. Split enter/exit buttons now share a single `storageKey` (`ah:fab-pos-split-v3`) so the button position persists across mode transitions instead of jumping between two saved positions.
22. Agent report fabrication detected: an agent attributed bugs to specific commits (`d3e1130`, `2760f85`) that never touched the claimed code paths — the "regressions" were actually pre-existing gaps, not caused by those commits. Always verify agent-generated root cause attribution against actual `git diff`.
23. Semantic RAG with `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` implemented and benchmarked (+28% precision, +38% recall) but shelved to `feature/semantic-rag` branch — PyTorch ~2GB dependency contradicts the lightweight self-hosted tool positioning.
24. Lightweight FTS5 RAG (`store_insights`, `query_insights`, `ProgressInsight` model, backfill endpoint) cherry-picked back to master as the production RAG solution — zero extra dependencies, uses SQLite's built-in full-text search with 7-day recency boost.
25. Release readiness assessment: with Tasks page disabled, remaining modules (Projects, Agents, Git, Monitor, Split Screen) are complete enough to ship; P0 blockers are screenshots/demo GIF for README, `install.sh` script, complete `.env.example`, and macOS compatibility (code depends on `/proc/meminfo`).


## 2026-03-08 — Daily Insights
1. Backend thumbnail system added: `/api/thumbs/{project}/{path}` endpoint generates max-1200px JPEG thumbnails (quality 80) via Pillow, cached in `.thumbcache/` directories — 35MB PNG → 275KB JPEG (127x compression), first generation ~1s, cached serves in 2ms.
2. Initial thumbnail size of 400px was too blurry for fullscreen lightbox on phones — increased to 1200px (230-275KB) which is sharp enough on any phone screen while still loading fast.
3. `resolveFileUrl()` in `formatters.jsx` didn't handle `.agenthive/uploads/` paths — user-uploaded images echoed in agent messages routed to `/api/files/{project}/...` → 404; fixed with `uploadMatch` branch routing to `/api/uploads/`.
4. `ImagePreview` error handling redesigned from single `error` state (silently hid image) to two-stage: `thumbFailed` → try full-res `src` → then show error UI with Retry button.
5. Lightbox progressive loading: shows 1200px thumbnail immediately, preloads full-res via `new Image()` in background, auto-swaps when loaded; if full-res never loads, user still sees usable thumbnail.
6. iOS Safari PWA completely ignores `<a download>` attribute and programmatic `a.click()` — the only reliable download method is `navigator.share({ files: [file] })` which opens the native share sheet for "Save Image".
7. `window.open` in PWA standalone mode opens Safari in a new tab where self-signed certs aren't accepted — results in white screen; must stay within PWA browsing context.
8. Download strategy by platform: iOS PWA standalone (detected via `(display-mode: standalone)` + `ontouchend`) → `navigator.share`; desktop/Android → blob URL + `<a download>`; fallback → `window.location.href` with `Content-Disposition: attachment`.
9. `permanently_delete_agent()` had file-before-DB ordering bug — deleted files first, then if `db.commit()` failed, files were gone but DB still referenced them; fixed to commit DB first.
10. `Message.agent_id` and `Task.agent_id` ForeignKey missing `ondelete="CASCADE"` — deleting an Agent without first deleting Messages triggers constraint error.
11. `evict_session()` had no worktree support — didn't clean worktree session cache directories, causing disk leak; also lacked try/except around `os.unlink`/`shutil.rmtree`.
12. 10+ code paths set `agent.status = AgentStatus.STOPPED` but only 2-3 called `tmux kill-session` — created `_kill_agent_tmux()` helper and added it to all stop sites.
13. `orphan_cleanup.py` only cleaned JSONL files and logs, never checked tmux sessions — added `ah-*` pattern scanning against DB to detect and kill orphan tmux sessions.
14. SYNCING agent with `tmux_pane` skipped stale check due to `elif` in `_reap_dead_agents` — Claude CLI idle at prompt counted as "alive" forever; fixed by adding session file freshness check even when pane is alive.
15. `send_tmux_message` Ink TUI timing: Escape/C-a/C-k control sequences are treated as literal text by Claude CLI's Ink TUI (regression); reverted to C-u only, kept increased delays (0.05s → 0.2s) and Enter retry logic.
16. Auto-summary March 7 bug confirmed: trigger fires at UTC midnight (16:00 PST) but queried "today UTC" (empty) instead of "yesterday UTC"; fix in `05ee345` added `target_date=yesterday` but March 7 data required manual backfill from backup DB.
17. RAG insights not injected on initial agent launch: `create_agent` → `_launch_tmux_background` bypassed `_build_agent_prompt` entirely — first message never got RAG; fixed by calling `_build_agent_prompt` before launch.
18. Five independent message dispatch paths (`launch_tmux_agent`, `create_agent` non-tmux, `send_agent_message` direct, `_dispatch_tmux_pending`, `_dispatch_pending_messages`) each independently handled RAG, message creation, and prompt wrapping — consolidated into single `_prepare_dispatch` method.
19. `_AGENTHIVE_PROMPT_MARKER` (`<!-- agenthive-prompt -->`) embedded in wrapped prompts prevents sync loop from re-importing them as duplicate USER messages — replaces fragile string-prefix matching.
20. Codebase fragmentation audit found 10 anti-patterns: 18 agent-stop paths, 5 message-failure paths, 24 direct task-status assignments, 11 session/pane clearing paths, inconsistent WS broadcasts — each with different side effects.
21. Four consolidation refactors completed via parallel worktree agents: `stop_agent_cleanup()` (26 inline stops → 1), `_fail_message()`/`_fail_pending_messages()` (5 FAILED paths → 2), `TaskStateMachine.transition()` (24 assignments → validated transitions with auto-timestamps), `_clear_agent_session()`/`_clear_agent_pane()` (18 clears → 2 with consistent notification).
22. Critical silent-hang bug fixed: max-retries-exhausted path in `_reap_dead_agents` cleared `session_id` with zero notification (no system message, no WS emit) — agent appeared frozen in UI indefinitely.
23. `orchestrator/utils.py` created to deduplicate `utcnow()` (5 identical copies across models/dispatcher/agent_dispatcher/task_state/main) and `truncate()` (2 copies).
24. Frontend deduplication: `useAsyncHandler` hook replaced 9 identical async handler patterns; `ErrorAlert` component replaced 4 identical error banners; `ReviewCard` ternary chains replaced with lookup map.
25. Backup system made configurable: `BACKUP_ENABLED` toggle and `BACKUP_DIR` custom path in `.env`/`config.py`; Monitor page got Backup card with snapshot count, total size display, and "Purge all" button.
