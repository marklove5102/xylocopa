# Contributing to Xylocopa

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Xylocopa! Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, or submitting code, your help is welcome.

## Reporting Bugs

Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jyao97/AgentHive/issues) with:

- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Relevant logs (check `logs/server.log` and `logs/orchestrator.log`)
- Your environment (OS, Python version, Node version, browser)

## Suggesting Features

Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jyao97/AgentHive/issues) and label it as a feature request. Describe the use case and why the feature would be valuable. If you have ideas about implementation, include them — but the "why" matters more than the "how."

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended)
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- tmux
- Claude Code CLI (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jyao97/AgentHive.git xylocopa
cd xylocopa

# Set up Python
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r orchestrator/requirements.txt

# Set up frontend
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — at minimum set HOST_PROJECTS_DIR

# Generate self-signed SSL certs (see README.md for full instructions)
mkdir -p certs
LAN_IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout certs/selfsigned.key -out certs/selfsigned.crt \
  -subj "/CN=xylocopa" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:xylocopa,DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1,IP:${LAN_IP}"

# Start the application
./run.sh start
```

## Running Tests

Backend:

```bash
cd orchestrator && python3 -m pytest tests/
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend && npx vitest run
```

## Code Style

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase. Don't introduce new conventions.
- Match the indentation, naming, and structure of surrounding code.
- No unnecessary refactors or renames — keep changes focused on the task.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `master`.
2. Keep PRs small and focused — one logical change per PR.
3. Write a clear description of what the PR does and why.
4. Make sure tests pass before submitting.
5. Use the commit message format: `[scope] brief description` (e.g., `[frontend] fix image zoom gesture`).
